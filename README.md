# webStorytelling

**Before starting**, you have to update the following files with your own keys, usernames, passwords, etc.:
1. index.php
2. edit_story_form.php
3. insert_story_form.php
4. my_stories.php
5. single_story.php
6. includes/db_config.php
...

**Also**, you have to change all local server paths. e.g. "C:/..." **and** create the database.
